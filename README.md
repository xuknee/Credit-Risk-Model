# Credit Card Fraud Risk Analysis

## Overview

This project provides an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for credit card fraud risk analysis using a large, real-world transactional dataset. It includes data exploration, feature engineering, model training (with Random Forest), and risk scoring. The analysis is visualized with informative plots and delivers actionable fraud risk scores for every transaction. The goal is to support data scientists and financial professionals in developing effective fraud detection systems.

## Dataset
